            The Law Office Panevski was founded by Lawyer Kristijan Panevski in
            2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a short period of time, the quality and commitment to our work
            and clients were recognized by most of the largest companies both in
            the Republic of Macedonia and in the region, as well as
            multinational companies that gave us their trust and privilege to
            represent their rights and interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            While providing quality legal assistance to our clients is our top
            priority, what sets us apart from the rest is the way we deliver our
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our unique approach to providing legal assistance is made possible
            by our wide circle of carefully selected associates.
          </p>
          <p>
            We communicate with our clients in Macedonian and English, and if
            necessary, we also cooperate with top translators in all world
            languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team is carefully selected and has extensive professional
            knowledge and experience in the areas of law in which we work, but
            above all, all members of our team have great human qualities, which
            we believe are a prerequisite for any work and for satisfied
            clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our law office offers legal assistance in various areas of law, from
            drafting common contracts, disputes and advisory opinions, to huge
            international disputes, negotiations and agreements of high profile
            and importance.
